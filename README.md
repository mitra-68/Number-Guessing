# Number Guessing Game 🎯

This is a simple number guessing game I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm looking for feedback on the design and responsiveness of the game interface, especially how it looks and works on different screen sizes.

## 💬 What I'd Love Feedback On

- How does the design look to you?
- Does it work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop?
- Any ideas to improve the layout, colors, or animations?
